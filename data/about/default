<h3>Smash Drafter</h3>

<p>This is a web tool for a semi-random Smash 4 set.  It pits two teams of two
players in a best of 3 series.</p>

<p>The teams each get 1 ban, this can be used to remove characters that the teams
don't want to play themselves or to limit their opponents from using a preferred
character.  After bans, teams alternate picking characters.  A player can swap their
pick using the "swap" button in the bottom right.  After the first match, the losing
team gets to pick all of their characters before the winning team.</p>

<p>The characters are removed upon being selected, so as the set goes on, the choice
of characters available for players shrinks.</p>

<p>These rules are all customizable.</p>
